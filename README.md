# nrdm_ws_python

A Python library for accessing National Retail Data Monitor data that wraps the NRDM SOAP-based interface.

The National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM) monitors anonymous sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products to identify disease outbreaks. The goal of the NRDM project has been to bring this new type of public health surveillance data to health departments to meet the nationâ€™s need for the early detection of bioterrorism as well as naturally occurring disease outbreaks.

Since its activation with public health departments in December 2002, the number of retail pharmacy, grocery, and mass merchandise operations that participate in the NRDM has grown to more than 28,000 stores, from fourteen chains. More than 800 public health officials, across 49 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories, have had access to the system via protected user accounts.

Access to the National Retail Data Monitor is available to public health officials solely for the purpose of public health surveillance. For specific information, call or email the Program Manager of the NRDM at www.rods.pitt.edu.
